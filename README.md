# Blink-Authentication
This study proposes a Dynamic Biometric Authentication System (DBAS) combining facial recognition with unique eye-blink patterns using EOG signals. Blink data is captured via an Arduino-based device and processed with LDA for secure user authentication, addressing weaknesses in current static biometric systems.
